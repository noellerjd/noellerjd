## Hi there âœ¨
**I'm Justin, and this is my github page!**

I'm a SWE working on my BS in Computer Science.

_I have a passion for learning, and programming is helping me feed my brain!_

### Here, you'll see:

Many of my projects are primarily built with ReactJS and NextJS. I've worked quite a bit with Python while creating my own personal Discord bot using discord.py, and I've also got some Java experience as well under my tool belt through my classes.

### I'm currently:

Working on a more refined and cleaner [portfolio site](https://github.com/noellerjd/Portfolio-Site) so I can add it to my resume, but down the pipeline, I have a few different projects I want to work on.
- Chrome/Firefox Extension to set a sleep timer on videos, for when you're watching a long video that you may fall asleep to or in the background (No more forgetting where you left off!).
- Platformer game through JavaScript that I can hopefully implement into my portfolio site (To make browsing it a bit more exciting!).
- Continuing to refine my [Task Manager App](https://github.com/noellerjd/Task-Manager-App) to make it even more useful; I do still use this one daily.
- Working on an RPG Minecraft Plugin using Java.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out!
